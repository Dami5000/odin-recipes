        <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup buffalo sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sriracha</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pound chicken breast</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Over medium heat, add buffalo sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, sriracha, minced garlic, honey, butter, and red pepper flakes to a pot or saucepan. Bring to a simmer to thicken into a glaze. Once it is thick, take off the heat and transfer to a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut chicken breast into small pieces.</li>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, whisk together cornstarch, a sprinkle of salt, and a sprinkle of black pepper.</li>
        <li>In small deep bowl, whisk together eggs, a sprinkle of salt, and a sprinkle of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil to 350Â°F in a frying pan.</li>
        <li>Dip a few chicken pieces at a time first in the dry batter, shaking any excess drip off, and then into the wet, letting any excess drip off.</li>
        <li>Drop the breaded chicken in, making sure not to overcrowd. Fry in two batches. Once golden, about 6 to 7 minutes, take out of the oil and drain any excess oil on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Toss the chicken in the glaze. If the glaze has thickened too much as it cools, warm it up for 10 seconds in the microwave first and then toss.</li>
        <li>Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds and enjoy with rice, noodles, or veggies!</li>
    </ol>
