        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>pork shoulder (collar / butt) (cut into chunks)</li>
            <li>4 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>4 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>2 tsp chilli powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp marjoram</li>
            <li>4 large pinches of kosher / flaky salt</li>
            <li>1 large orange (zest and juice)</li>
            <li>Lard or Tallow (enough to cover meat)</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 large cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>Lime</li>
            <li>White onion</li>
            <li>Coriander</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together the ingredients for the marinade in a bowl - cumin, paprika, chilli powder, marjoram, salt, orange zest and juice. Add the pork, toss in the spices and leave to marinate in the fridge overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat a fan oven to 110 C / 230 F. Heat a large pan of lard to 95 C  / 203 F and place in the marinated pork. Cook in the lard for a few minutes then add in the rest of the ingredients. Put a lid on top of the pan, and place into the oven. Cook for 2 - 2.5 hours until juicy and tender.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the pan from the oven and leave the meat to cool in the liquid (helps maintain the juices in the pork).</li>
            <li>Once at room temperature, place the meat into a roasting tray and cook under the grill until slightly crisped on top. Remove and set aside until ready to use for the tacos.</li>
            <li>Grab yourself a warm corn tortilla and fill it up with lots of the pork. Add some finely diced white onion and coriander, squeeze over some lime juice and drizzle a little of the flavour-packed lard that the meat cooked in.</li>
        </ol>
